# 🤖 AI Chatbot Assistant (First Version)

A simple, beginner-friendly chatbot that simulates AI responses using basic JavaScript logic.

This project was created to practice JavaScript fundamentals like DOM manipulation, user input handling, conditional logic, and dynamic UI updates — all without using real APIs. The chatbot gives the illusion of AI by using `if/else` statements to respond to user input.
